# GeometryInSpace
This is an educational 3D game with a very simple interface developed using Processing and P3D render.

The main goal of the project is to create an educational game called “Geometry in space”.
This game allows the user to view a 3D model of the chosen geometric body. The user can
also select the type of visualization between “Wireframe” and “Volumetric” and the color of
the shape.
The idea is to implement scaling, translation and rotation transformations for each body,
allowing the user to move around the body to gaze at all the details of the shape, including
from inside it, creating the ilusion that the user is "walking".

(This was a project developed for Computer Graphic Elements subject in University of Oradea, Romania)
